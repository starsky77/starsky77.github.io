<!-- TODO: Refine this part for PhD application -->

I started my Computer Science PhD study in 24 Fall at <a href=' https://www.ucsb.edu/'> University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB)</a>, advised by Professor <a href=' https://psych.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/miguel-eckstein'> Miguel Eckstein</a> in <a href=' https://viu.psych.ucsb.edu/'> Vision and Image Understanding Lab (VIU)</a>.

My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision and cognitive psychology. Currently, I focus on developing computational models for human scene understanding. I am also interested in the emergent behavior of deep learning models that align with or differ from human behavior, and investigating what's the reason behind that.

Before attending UCSB, I earned my master degree <a href="https://mcds.cs.cmu.edu/">Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS)</a> degree of the **Language Technologies Institute (LTI)** in the **School of Computer Science (SCS)** at <a href='https://www.cmu.edu/'>Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)</a>. advised by Prof.<a href='https://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/~tai/'>Tai Sing Lee </a>. Before attened CMU, I have received me bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Technology from **Zhejiang University (ZJU)** in China, supervised by Prof.<a href='https://zhpcui.github.io/'>Zhaopeng Cui</a>. I was also minor in Psychology during undergraduate studying.

<!-- My current research primarily concentrates on the inherent biases towards shape and texture in different computer vision models. It has been shown that human vision exhibits a profound bias towards shapes, utilizing geons and compositional reasoning to excel in generalizing across vastly distinct domains. Drawing inspiration from the complex functioning of the visual cortex in processing image information, our objective is to construct a deep learning model that can effectively comprehend the global shape within images. The culmination of this endeavor aims to yield a model that can exhibit increased robustness and demonstrates superior generalization capacity. -->

<!-- I'm a second-year graduate student in <a href='https://www.cmu.edu/'>Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)</a>, pursing the <a href="https://mcds.cs.cmu.edu/">Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS)</a> degree of the Language Technologies Institute (LTI) in the School of Computer Science (SCS). Currently I'm doing research under supervision of Prof.<a href='https://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/~tai/'>Tai Sing Lee </a>. Before attened CMU, I have received me bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Technology from Zhejiang University (ZJU) in China. I was also minor in psychology during undergradeate studying.

My current research primarily concentrates on the inherent biases towards shape and texture in different computer vision models. This question raises critical considerations concerning both the robustness and the generalizability of these models. Specifically, shape representation could be considered a robust and interpretable feature from a human cognitive perspective, as models biased towards shape have demonstrated superior generalization when tested using Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) datasets.

It has been shown that human vision exhibits a profound bias towards shapes, utilizing geons and compositional reasoning to excel in generalizing across vastly distinct domains. Drawing inspiration from the complex functioning of the visual cortex in processing image information, our objective is to construct a deep learning model that can effectively comprehend the global shape within images. The culmination of this endeavor aims to yield a model that can exhibit increased robustness and demonstrates superior generalization capacity.

Before attending CMU, I have worded in State Key Laboratory of CAD & CG at Zhejiang University, supervised by Prof. Zhaopeng Cui <a href='https://zhpcui.github.io/'>Zhaopeng Cui</a>. Our research centered around 3D vision and Automated Machine Learning (AutoML). Our primary objective was to enhance the efficiency of models dealing with large-scale point cloud segmentation problems while maintain the accuracy of the model. Specifically, we utilized an efficient neighborhood gathering technique to improve the efficiency of Dynamic Graph CNN (DGCNN) apply one-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to search for the optimal structure of the network. -->
