Here are things other than scientific research

## Personal Interest

Except for computer science and artificial intelligence, my personal interest subjects are psychology and philosophy, especially about topics related to Ethics, ego and lifespan development.

Enjoy visiting bookstore and natural landscapes.

## Quotes

*"It was but yesterday I thought myself a fragment quivering without rhythm in the sphere of life.*

*Now I know that I am the sphere, and all life in rhythmic fragments moves within me."*   -- Kahlil Gibran
